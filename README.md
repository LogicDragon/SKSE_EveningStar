# SKSE_EveningStar

Realistic astronomy mod for Skyrim (Oldrim).


## Features

- The sun, moons, and stars are now positioned using realistic astronomical calculations.
- Dynamic sunrise/sunset times depending on time of year. This makes it so days are longer during summer and shorter during winter.
- Latitude calculations that changes the sunrise/sunset times depending on how far north you go.
- Npc schedules changes depending on sunrise/sunset times.
- Additional textures for each moon phase, each phase now has 3 textures. Masser and Secunda each now has 24 textures.
- Nighttime light calculations depending on moon phase (for light reflecting off the moons surface). Full moon has max brightness, new moon has min brightness.
- The color of the moons changes as they get closer to the horizon due to light refraction.
- Solar eclipses can now occur for both Masser and Secunda depending on their position. It is more common for Masser due to its larger size.
